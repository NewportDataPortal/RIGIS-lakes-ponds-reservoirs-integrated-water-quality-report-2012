<abstract>Vector polygon data representing Rhode Island Lakes, Ponds and Reservoirs included in the State's Integrated Water Quality and Assessment Report required under provisions of the US Clean Water Act The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, Office of Water Resources has developed this document to provide information on Rhode Island water quality required biennially by Section 305(b) and periodically by Section 303(d) of the federal Water Pollution Control Act (the Clean Water Act). This first Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report is intended to meet the reporting requirements of Sections 106, 303(d), 305(b), 314 and 319 of the Clean Water Act. This report integrates the previously separate 305(b) State of the State?s Waters Report and the 303(d) List of Impaired Waters. The narrative focus of this Integrated Report is shifted away from the extensive program descriptions presented in previous 305(b) Reports (website links are provided to guide interested readers to additional program information). Instead the Integrated Report is focused to highlight the environmental results that these programs have achieved or new programs and initiatives that have developed during the reporting cycle.</abstract>
<purpose>These data are published as an aid to understanding and interpreting the State's Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report found at: http://www.dem.ri.gov/programs/benviron/water/quality/surfwq/iwqmon.htm</purpose>
<supplinf>PLEASE NOTE: A Water Quality Standard describes an ideal condition or goal for a waterbody. In many cases a waterbody may not meet the standard. In those situations the waterbody is included on the State 303(d) list and the State is required to develop a plan (TMDL) to restore the waterbody to it's standard condition. In the new integrated report data format, only waterbodies in category 5 (IR_Cat) are included on the303d list</supplinf>

BoatRamp - is there a public boatramp on the waterbody
Rstrctn - aka Restriction.  Are there limits or prohibitions against motor boats
ShoreMiles - shoreline perimeter length in miles
SRPW - Special Resource Protection Waters
Special Resource Protection Waters (SRPWs) are high quality surface waters identified by the
Director as having significant ecological or recreational uses, which may include but are not
limited to: wildlife refuge or management areas; public drinking water supplies; State and Federal
parks; State and Federal designated Estuarine Sanctuary Areas; waterbodies containing critical
habitats, which may include but are not limited to waterbodies identified by the RIDEM Natural
Heritage Program as critical habitat for rare or endangered species; wetland types or specific
wetlands listed as rare, threatened, endangered, of special interest or of special concern by the RI
Natural Heritage Program; waterbodies identified by the U.S. Department of the Interior on the
Final List of Rivers for potential inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.
Cold - Cold Water Fishery designation
Cold waters are or should be capable of supporting cold water fish species.  Some waterbodies within this class are currently sampling as warm, but with proper managment could be restored to a cold water fish habitat.
Warm waters support warm water fish species
Una or unassessed are waterbodies that have not been sampled or assessed for this classification
WQS - Water Quality Standard
Class AA@ - These waters are designated as a source of public drinking water supply (PDWS) or as
tributary waters within a public drinking water supply watershed (the terminal reservoir of the PDWS are
identified in Appendix A), for primary and secondary contact recreational activities and for fish and
wildlife habitat. These waters shall have excellent aesthetic value.
Class A - These waters are designated for primary and secondary contact recreational activities and for
fish and wildlife habitat. They shall be suitable for compatible industrial processes and cooling,
hydropower, aquacultural uses, navigation, and irrigation and other agricultural uses. These waters shall
have excellent aesthetic value.
Class B* - These waters are designated for fish and wildlife habitat and primary and secondary contact
recreational activities. They shall be suitable for compatible industrial processes and cooling,
hydropower, aquacultural uses, navigation, and irrigation and other agricultural uses. These waters shall
have good aesthetic value.
Class B1* - These waters are designated for primary and secondary contact recreational activities and fish
and wildlife habitat. They shall be suitable for compatible industrial processes and cooling, hydropower,
aquacultural uses, navigation, and irrigation and other agricultural uses. These waters shall have good
aesthetic value. Primary contact recreational activities may be impacted due to pathogens from approved
wastewater discharges. However all Class B criteria must be met.
Class C - These waters are designated for secondary contact recreational activities and fish and wildlife
habitat. They shall be suitable for compatible industrial processes and cooling, hydropower, aquacultural
uses, navigation, and irrigation and other agricultural uses. These water shall have good aesthetic value.
@ Class AA waters used for public drinking water supply may be subject to restricted recreational use by State
and local authorities.
Class SA@ * - These waters are designated for shellfish harvesting for direct human consumption,
primary and secondary contact recreational activities, and fish and wildlife habitat. They shall be suitable
for aquacultural uses, navigation, and industrial cooling. These waters shall have good aesthetic value.
Class SB* - These waters are designated for primary and secondary contact recreational activities;
shellfish harvesting for controlled relay and depuration; and fish and wildlife habitat. They shall be
suitable for aquacultural uses, navigation, and industrial cooling. These waters shall have good aesthetic
value.
Class SB1* - These waters are designated for primary and secondary contact recreational activities and
fish and wildlife habitat. They shall be suitable for aquacultural uses, navigation, and industrial cooling.
These waters shall have good aesthetic value. Primary contact recreational activities may be impacted
due to pathogens from approved wastewater discharges. However all Class SB criteria must be met.
Class SC - These waters are designated for secondary contact recreational activities, and fish and wildlife
habitat. They shall be suitable for aquacultural uses, navigation, and industrial cooling. These waters
shall have good aesthetic value.
CAT - Category aka 303d listing, water not attaining designated uses
Category 1
Attaining all designated uses. Waterbodies will be placed into this
Category if, in accordance with the requirements of the CALM, the assessment results indicate that 
the waterbody is attaining all water quality standards for all designated uses.
Category 2
Attaining some of the designated uses; and insufficient or no data and information 
is available to determine if the remaining uses are attained. Waterbodies will be placed in this 
Category if there are data and information which, in accordance with the CALM, support a
determination that some, but not all, uses are attained and attainment
status of the remaining uses is unknown because there is insufficient or no data or information.
Category 3
Insufficient or no data and information are available to determine if any designated 
use is attained or impaired. Waterbodies will be placed in this Category where the data or 
information to support an attainment determination for all uses are not sufficient, consistent with 
the requirements of the CALM.  In general, these uses and waterbodies are considered Not Assessed.
Category 4
Impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses but does not require 
development of a TMDL. (Three subcategories):
A.     TMDL has been completed. Waterbodies will be placed in this subcategory once all TMDLs for 
the waterbody have been developed and approved by EPA.
B.     Other pollution control requirements are reasonably expected to result in attainment of the 
water quality standard in the near
future.  Waterbodies will be placed in this subcategory where other
pollution control requirements are stringent enough to attain applicable water quality standards.
C.     Impairment is not caused by a pollutant.  Waterbodies will be placed in this subcategory if 
pollution (e.g., flow) rather than a pollutant causes the impairment.
Category 5
Impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses by a pollutant(s), and 
requires a TMDL.  This Category constitutes the
303(d) List of waters impaired or threatened by a pollutant(s) for which
one or more TMDL(s) are needed.
