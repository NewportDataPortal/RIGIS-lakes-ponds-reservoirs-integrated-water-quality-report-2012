  Description:
    Abstract: Vector polygon data representing Rhode Island Lakes, Ponds and Reservoirs included in the State's Integrated Water Quality and Assessment Report required under provisions of the US Clean Water Act The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, Office of Water Resources has developed this document to provide information on Rhode Island water quality required biennially by Section 305(b) and periodically by Section 303(d) of the federal Water Pollution Control Act (the Clean Water Act). This first Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report is intended to meet the reporting requirements of Sections 106, 303(d), 305(b), 314 and 319 of the Clean Water Act. This report integrates the previously separate 305(b) State of the State?s Waters Report and the 303(d) List of Impaired Waters. The narrative focus of this Integrated Report is shifted away from the extensive program descriptions presented in previous 305(b) Reports (website links are provided to guide interested readers to additional program information). Instead the Integrated Report is focused to highlight the environmental results that these programs have achieved or new programs and initiatives that have developed during the reporting cycle.
    Purpose: These data are published as an aid to understanding and interpreting the State's Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report found at: http://www.dem.ri.gov/programs/benviron/water/quality/surfwq/iwqmon.htm
    Supplemental_Information: PLEASE NOTE: A Water Quality Standard describes an ideal condition or goal for a waterbody. In many cases a waterbody may not meet the standard. In those situations the waterbody is included on the State 303(d) list and the State is required to develop a plan (TMDL) to restore the waterbody to it's standard condition. In the new integrated report data format, only waterbodies in category 5 (IR_Cat) are included on the303d list

      ShoreMiles - shoreline perimeter length in miles
      SRPW - Special Resource Protection Waters
      Special Resource Protection Waters (SRPWs) are high quality surface waters identified by the
      Director as having significant ecological or recreational uses, which may include but are not
      limited to: wildlife refuge or management areas; public drinking water supplies; State and Federal
      parks; State and Federal designated Estuarine Sanctuary Areas; waterbodies containing critical
      habitats, which may include but are not limited to waterbodies identified by the RIDEM Natural
      Heritage Program as critical habitat for rare or endangered species; wetland types or specific
      wetlands listed as rare, threatened, endangered, of special interest or of special concern by the RI
      Natural Heritage Program; waterbodies identified by the U.S. Department of the Interior on the
      Final List of Rivers for potential inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.
      Cold - Cold Water Fishery designation
      Cold waters are or should be capable of supporting cold water fish species.  Some waterbodies within this class are currently sampling as warm, but with proper managment could be restored to a cold water fish habitat.
      Warm waters support warm water fish species
      Una or unassessed are waterbodies that have not been sampled or assessed for this classification
      WQS - Water Quality Standard
      Class AA@ - These waters are designated as a source of public drinking water supply (PDWS) or as
      tributary waters within a public drinking water supply watershed (the terminal reservoir of the PDWS are
      identified in Appendix A), for primary and secondary contact recreational activities and for fish and
      wildlife habitat. These waters shall have excellent aesthetic value.
      Class A - These waters are designated for primary and secondary contact recreational activities and for
      fish and wildlife habitat. They shall be suitable for compatible industrial processes and cooling,
      hydropower, aquacultural uses, navigation, and irrigation and other agricultural uses. These waters shall
      have excellent aesthetic value.
      Class B* - These waters are designated for fish and wildlife habitat and primary and secondary contact
      recreational activities. They shall be suitable for compatible industrial processes and cooling,
      hydropower, aquacultural uses, navigation, and irrigation and other agricultural uses. These waters shall
      have good aesthetic value.
      Class B1* - These waters are designated for primary and secondary contact recreational activities and fish
      and wildlife habitat. They shall be suitable for compatible industrial processes and cooling, hydropower,
      aquacultural uses, navigation, and irrigation and other agricultural uses. These waters shall have good
      aesthetic value. Primary contact recreational activities may be impacted due to pathogens from approved
      wastewater discharges. However all Class B criteria must be met.
      Class C - These waters are designated for secondary contact recreational activities and fish and wildlife
      habitat. They shall be suitable for compatible industrial processes and cooling, hydropower, aquacultural
      uses, navigation, and irrigation and other agricultural uses. These water shall have good aesthetic value.
      @ Class AA waters used for public drinking water supply may be subject to restricted recreational use by State
      and local authorities.
      Class SA@ * - These waters are designated for shellfish harvesting for direct human consumption,
      primary and secondary contact recreational activities, and fish and wildlife habitat. They shall be suitable
      for aquacultural uses, navigation, and industrial cooling. These waters shall have good aesthetic value.
      Class SB* - These waters are designated for primary and secondary contact recreational activities;
      shellfish harvesting for controlled relay and depuration; and fish and wildlife habitat. They shall be
      suitable for aquacultural uses, navigation, and industrial cooling. These waters shall have good aesthetic
      value.
      Class SB1* - These waters are designated for primary and secondary contact recreational activities and
      fish and wildlife habitat. They shall be suitable for aquacultural uses, navigation, and industrial cooling.
      These waters shall have good aesthetic value. Primary contact recreational activities may be impacted
      due to pathogens from approved wastewater discharges. However all Class SB criteria must be met.
      Class SC - These waters are designated for secondary contact recreational activities, and fish and wildlife
      habitat. They shall be suitable for aquacultural uses, navigation, and industrial cooling. These waters
      shall have good aesthetic value.
      CAT - Category aka 303d listing, water not attaining designated uses
      Category 1
      Attaining all designated uses. Waterbodies will be placed into this
      Category if, in accordance with the requirements of the CALM, the assessment results indicate that 
      the waterbody is attaining all water quality standards for all designated uses.
      Category 2
      Attaining some of the designated uses; and insufficient or no data and information 
      is available to determine if the remaining uses are attained. Waterbodies will be placed in this 
      Category if there are data and information which, in accordance with the CALM, support a
      determination that some, but not all, uses are attained and attainment
      status of the remaining uses is unknown because there is insufficient or no data or information.
      Category 3
      Insufficient or no data and information are available to determine if any designated 
      use is attained or impaired. Waterbodies will be placed in this Category where the data or 
      information to support an attainment determination for all uses are not sufficient, consistent with 
      the requirements of the CALM.  In general, these uses and waterbodies are considered Not Assessed.
      Category 4
      Impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses but does not require 
      development of a TMDL. (Three subcategories):
      A.     TMDL has been completed. Waterbodies will be placed in this subcategory once all TMDLs for 
      the waterbody have been developed and approved by EPA.
      B.     Other pollution control requirements are reasonably expected to result in attainment of the 
      water quality standard in the near
      future.  Waterbodies will be placed in this subcategory where other
      pollution control requirements are stringent enough to attain applicable water quality standards.
      C.     Impairment is not caused by a pollutant.  Waterbodies will be placed in this subcategory if 
      pollution (e.g., flow) rather than a pollutant causes the impairment.
      Category 5
      Impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses by a pollutant(s), and 
      requires a TMDL.  This Category constitutes the
      303(d) List of waters impaired or threatened by a pollutant(s) for which
      one or more TMDL(s) are needed.
